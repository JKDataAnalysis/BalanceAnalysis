Balance analysis script version notes
=====================================

Still required
--------------

* [DEFERRED INDEFINITELY] Identification of periods of double contact in single-leg stances
	- determine how to handle these gaps

As of version 1.1
* The following parameters calculated
	- Total path length
	- CoFPL velocity
	- AP CoF amplitude
	- ML CoF amplitude
	- AP CoF velocity
	- ML CoF velocity
	- CoF 95% ellipse area
* Read sample time from header of data file
* Limit data used in analyses to start time to end time
* Implemented changes to reading settings
* Added scaling factor to convert units to mm (if required)
* Sample duration calculation modified so that it is not sensitive to skipped frames at the start/ end of trials
* Write results to CSV file
* Writing descriptive stats to file added
* Extracting trial category from file names using Regex
* Added calculation of no of frames

Version 1.2
* Modification to allow script to run on Mac/ Linux
	- dropped use of psych library and replaced with e1071- Stats calculated individually
	- Added tcltk::tk_choose.files option when platform$OS.type == Unix (Should return 'unix for Unix, Linux, and Mac OSX)
		- Does not allow the default index of file type to be set so choose.files option retained for Windows machines
* Added analysis of frame skipping for Tekscan files
* Kurtosis/ skew type added to analysis file settings

Version 1.3
* Correction to x/y path length calcuations. The absolute values of the differences between each frames are taken before summing
* Modification of all speed calculations so columns for time derivatives are just appended later for all path lengths (x, y, xy)

Version 1.4
* Grouped descriptive statistics now included 

Version 1.5
* Option to interpolate missing values added
* Where interpolated and non-filled data are both included in the analysis, the descriptive stats are returned on these separately. Will also return descriptive stats grouped by trial, so can return stats grouped by trial and interpolated/ not.
* Descriptive stats now written to a separate file rather than appended to the results
* [Bug fix] If a file (results or descriptive stats) failed to save, when the user was asked whether to retry. If they clicked 'No' it still opened the file save dialogue.
* File names deafults added to save dialogue
* Mean, SD and maximum size of all missed times as well as a cumulative count of the missing frames can now be obtained if run_it is called with miss = TRUE. These are used to generate missing times with a similar profile to the real data in modelling the effects of frame skipping by the Tekscan system (see FrameSkippingErrorModelling script) . These are all created as global variable (see FrameSkippingErrorAnalysisHowTo.txt for details).  A list of all missing times is also created in case more detailed profiling is required.
* [Bug fix] If only interpolated data were set to be used but there were data set with no missing values (so wouldn't be interpolated) then the descriptive statistics would still be grouped by un/interpolated, i.e. trials where there were no missing data would not be included in the statistics for the remainder of the trials.
* If either of the default settings files cannot be read from default folder([script path]\SettingsFiles) the user will now be asked to identify a valid file. (NB settings files were previously in the root of the script folder)
* [Bug fix] If a single file was passed, an attempt would still be made to calculate descriptive stats and script would crash
* A new function was added to check that the names of the data files match the file given in the file's header. This was introduced since it was observed that exporting files from Tekscan Footscan software is problematic. File names need to be set manually so when exporting from multiple files it is easy to mistake the file that is being corrected. This function is only called where the 'file_spec' in the AnalysisSpec file contains 'Footscan'.
[Bug fix] If the size of the gap where frames have been dropped exceeded the max frame gap size in the Analysis Spec file ('fg_max') then the script would crash. The reported maximum size of gap also reported the number of gaps of the maximum size rather than the no of frames skipped.
* Linear interpolation changed to spline.

Version 1.6
* Missing frame profile data (gap_max, gap_mean, gap_sd and gap_counts) now exported as a text file as well as creating the global variables.
* Analysis specification settings file path and name can now be passed into run_it(). This is essentially just to save having to locate it every time when doing development.
* Modified frame gap recording to use dataframe resizing rather than having to set the max frame gap to search for a priori in settings
* Modified settings files to reflect gap_max (maximum gap size to include) with fgap (logic- whether the include frame gap analysis). 
    [NOTE} This makes settings files for this version, incompatible with previous versions. Copies of the v1.5 compatible default files copied to a new folder.
