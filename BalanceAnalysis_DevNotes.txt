Balance analysis script version notes
=====================================

Still required
--------------

* [DEFERRED INDEFINITELY] Identification of periods of double contact in single-leg stances
	- determine how to handle these gaps

As of version 1.1
* The following parameters calculated
	- Total path length
	- CoFPL velocity
	- AP CoF amplitude
	- ML CoF amplitude
	- AP CoF velocity
	- ML CoF velocity
	- CoF 95% ellipse area
* Read sample time from header of data file
* Limit data used in analyses to start time to end time
* Implemented changes to reading settings
* Added scaling factor to convert units to mm (if required)
* Sample duration calculation modified so that it is not sensitive to skipped frames at the start/ end of trials
* Write results to CSV file
* Writing descriptive stats to file added
* Extracting trial category from file names using Regex
* Added calculation of no of frames

Version 1.2
* Modification to allow script to run on Mac/ Linux
	- dropped use of psych library and replaced with e1071- Stats calculated individually
	- Added tcltk::tk_choose.files option when platform$OS.type == Unix (Should return 'unix for Unix, Linux, and Mac OSX)
		- Does not allow the default index of file type to be set so choose.files option retained for Windows machines
* Added analysis of frame skipping for Tekscan files
* Kurtosis/ skew type added to analysis file settings

Version 1.3
* Correction to x/y path length calcuations. The absolute values of the differences between each frames are taken before summing
* Modification of all speed calculations so columns for time derivatives are just appended later for all path lengths (x, y, xy)

Version 1.4
* Grouped descriptive statistics now included 

Version 1.5
* Option to interpolate missing values added
* Where interpolated and non-filled data are both included in the analysis, the descriptive stats are returned on these separately. Will also return descriptive stats grouped by trial, so can return stats grouped by trial and interpolated/ not.
* Descriptive stats now written to a separate file rather than appended to the results
* [Bug fix] If a file (results or descriptive stats) failed to save, when the user was asked whether to retry. If they clicked 'No' it still opened the file save dialogue.
* File names deafults added to save dialogue
* Mean and SD of all missed times can now be obtained if run_it is called with miss = TRUE. These can be used to generate missing times with a similar profile to the real data in modelling the effects of frame skipping by the Tekscan system. A global variable is also created from the list of all missing times in case more detailed profiling is required.
