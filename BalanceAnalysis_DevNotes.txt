Balance analysis script version notes
=====================================

Still required
--------------

* [DEFERRED INDEFINITELY] Identification of periods of double contact in single-leg stances
	- determine how to handle these gaps
* Interpolation of gaps left by skipped frames (Only required for Tekscan data)
	- analysis of errors from skipped frames accounting for number of frames dropped and size of gaps

As of version 1.1
* The following parameters calculated
	- Total path length
	- CoFPL velocity
	- AP CoF amplitude
	- ML CoF amplitude
	- AP CoF velocity
	- ML CoF velocity
	- CoF 95% ellipse area
* Read sample time from header of data file
* Limit data used in analyses to start time to end time
* Implemented changes to reading settings
* Added scaling factor to convert units to mm (if required)
* Sample duration calculation modified so that it is not sensitive to skipped frames at the start/ end of trials
* Write results to CSV file
* Writing descriptive stats to file added
* Extracting trial category from file names using Regex
* Added calculation of no of frames

Version 1.2
* Modification to allow script to run on Mac/ Linux
	- dropped use of psych library and replaced with e1071- Stats calculated individually
	- Added tcltk::tk_choose.files option when platform$OS.type == Unix (Should return 'unix for Unix, Linux, and Mac OSX)
		- Does not allow the default index of file type to be set so choose.files option retained for Windows machines
* Added analysis of frame skipping for Tekscan files
* Kurtosis/ skew type added to analysis file settings

Version 1.3
* Correction to x/y path length calcuations. The absolute values of the differences between each frames are taken before summing
* Modification of all speed calculations so columns for time derivatives are just appended later for all path lengths (x, y, xy)

Version 1.4
* Grouped statistics now included
