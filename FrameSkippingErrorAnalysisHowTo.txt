Procedures for running analysis of errors resulting from missing data frames

1) Calculate mean and SD of missing values to build model from
	- Run the Balance Analysis script as 'run_it(miss = TRUE)'. This will create the following global variables;
		* gap_counts: containing the cumulative counts of each of the sizes of frame gaps
		* gap_mean and gap_sd: The mean and SD respectively of the missing times in the files analysed.
		* missing_times: Which is a list of all of the times missing from the files analyses 
	- The gap_* variables are used by the generate_model_data function in the next stage
	- 'missing_times' is not used but included as it may be useful for further analysis
	- For the frame gap profile to be representative, ALL available files should be included in the analysis
 
2) Generate model data
	- Run the Frame Skipping Error Modelling script as 'generate_model_data()' 
	- It is not necessary to select only files with no skipped frames, these will be ignored by the script.
	
3) Calculate parameters on model data
	- In the Analysis Specification file, change the value of;
		* 'file_spec' to 'FootscanError'
		* 'factor_regex' to '^\w{8}'
		* Ensure that both 'unfill' and 'interp' are set to 'T'.
	- Run the Balance Analysis script again as 'model_data <- run_it()'. This will return the results do a new data frame called 'model data'
	- Use the files generated in step 2 ('miss' does not need to be set to TRUE). 
	- (The results file can also be imported into a data frame as 'model_data' by copying and pasting (use clipr library))
	
4) Run error analysis by passing the model_data to the run_err_analysis funciton as 'run_err_analysis(model_data)'. This will perform 3 functions;
	i) Calculate errors by number of frames skipped for each variable
	ii) Plot the percentage errors by number of frames skipped for each variable
		- This will generate separate plots for range (x and y), path lengths (x, y and xy) and ellipse area grouped by whether the data used are the original or with interpolation 
	iii) Calculate linear regression model for each variable as a fucntion of the number of missing frames for interpolated and non-interpolated data. This is returned as a data frame in the global environment called 'regr'
